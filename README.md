# Movie_rental-Database

This database was created for a movie_rental store. It has 15 tables which contains the information of 1000 movies released in year 2006 ranging from their titles to the characters, countries, language, ratings and so on. It also contains the information of all the staffs in the store, information of all the customers that have patronized them: names, addresses, emails etc.

I extracted the script for this database from the query editor and converted it to a PDF file.
